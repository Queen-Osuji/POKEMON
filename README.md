POKEMON (CogniMon Protocol)
 POKEMON Protocol - Conceptual Demonstration

Important: This script is a simplified, conceptual illustration of how different POKEMON agents *might* interact within the proposed POKEMON Protocol. It does **not** represent functional software, connect to live AIs, or perform real tasks. It is for demonstration purposes only, to help visualize the flow of information and collaboration between specialized AI agents.

The `demo.py` script simulates a workflow where:
1. A "DataFetcherPOKEMON" (simulated) retrieves some information.
2. An "AnalyzerPOKEMON" (simulated) processes this information.
3. A "ReporterPOKEMON" (simulated) generates a summary.

This illustrates the core POKEMON idea: different agents, each with a specialty, working together on a larger task defined by the user via the POKEDECKâ„¢ (the envisioned platform).

To run (requires Python):
`python demo.py`
